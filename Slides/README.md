## Lectures

All the slides in this repository were created by Sidonie Bellot (all Genomics* slides + Phylogenomics* slides) and Jeronimo Cid Vian (Population_Genomics_JC slides), sometimes using material from others as credited directly on the slides.  
  
In addition, slides and tutorials explaining the analysis of Oxford Nanopore Technology (minion) data developped by Oscar A. PÃ©rez Escobar and used during the same workshops can be found [here](https://github.com/siriusb-nox/ONT-workshop-Oct-2023).
